# PokedexScraper
Python script that scrapes all the pokemon off of pokemondb and also bonus script for pokedex entries to from serebii
Current Issues: Decent amount of Pokemon failed to retrieve Pokedex entries, pokemon with multiple forms will have incorrect renders, abilities, height, weight, training, breeding information, and evolution info.
This also includes move lists. Basically, if a pokemon has multiple forms, the other forms of the same pokemon will have almost the same information as the base form. I will work on this later.
